# Raven Split Keyboard

The Raven keyboard (rvkbd) is a wireless, low-profile, split keyboard based on the [Corne keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) by foostan. It has a 3x5 column staggered layout with 3 thumb keys and 1 outer pinky key.

The goal of this project is to create a split layout with an aggressive, irregular stagger to match a sub-integer [2D:4D ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digit_ratio) of approximately 0.925. The 38-key layout is a product of countless iterations on my personal keymap, aiming to minimize finger movement and total keystrokes whilst maintaining a clean, logical distinction between layers.
